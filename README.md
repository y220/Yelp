## Goal
In this project, our project utilizes data from the Yelp that contains 76,254 reviews from 2,039 different pizza-related shops, and focuses on pizza related businesses in four state, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Specifically, we are interested in the following questions:

  --What are the distribution patterns of these restaurants? How about their feedback from customers?

  --Are there any interesting information can be extracted from customers' reviews and businessesâ€™ attributes?

  --Are there any specific variables that make a great difference based on statistical model results?

## Rule-of-thumb
Friendly service attitude, fast delivery and fresh ingredients are the most essential factors in increasing overall store score on the Yelp.
